I am a PhD candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley, on the academic job market for 2023-4. My advisors are Edward Miguel, Benjamin Faber, JÃ³n Steinsson, and Barry Eichengreen.

My research interests are in development and economic history. My job market paper studies the rural roots of China's miracle---in particular, the end of collective agriculture in the early 1980s---by applying machine learning to historical satellite imagery. My other research includes both historical work on the rise of East Asia and contemporary fieldwork in Kenya.
