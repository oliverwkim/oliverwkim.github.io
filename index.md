I am a PhD candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. My advisors are Edward Miguel, Benjamin Faber, JÃ³n Steinsson, and Barry Eichengreen.

My research interests are in development and economic history. My job market paper studies the rural roots of China's miracle---in particular, the end of collective agriculture in the early 1980s---by applying machine learning to historical satellite imagery. My other research includes both historical work on the rise of East Asia and contemporary fieldwork in Kenya.

I am a Research Fellow at Open Philanthropy, researching cause areas to fund in global health and development. I have a PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley, completed in 2024. and an AB in Economics from Harvard College, finished in 2016. I also worked as a research analyst at the New York Fed from 2016-18.

I also do academic research in development and economic history, broadly motivated around studying industrialization and structural transformation as solutions to extreme poverty. My research spans the historical causes of the East Asian Miracle to contemporary development questions in sub-Saharan Africa.
