![Oliver Kim.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/oliver_kim_photo.jpeg "Oliver Kim")

I am a PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley. I graduated from Harvard College in 2016, and worked at the New York Fed from 2016-18.

My research interests are in development, international economics, and economic history. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the processes of industrialization and structural transformation. My current research includes both contemporary fieldwork in Kenya, and historical work on the rise of the East Asian Tigers.
