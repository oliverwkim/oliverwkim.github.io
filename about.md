![Oliver Kim.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/oliver_kim_new_photo.JPG "Oliver Kim")

I am a PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley. I graduated from Harvard College in 2016, and worked at the New York Fed from 2016-18.

My research interests are in development, international economics, and economic history. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the processes of industrialization and structural transformation as means for alleviating extreme poverty. My current research includes both contemporary fieldwork in Kenya and historical work on the rise of the East Asian Tigers.
