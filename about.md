![Oliver Kim.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/oliver_kim_job_market.JPG "Oliver Kim. Photo credit to Nadia Kim.")

I am a PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley. I graduated from Harvard College in 2016, and worked at the New York Fed from 2016-18.

My research interests are in development, international economics, and economic history. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the processes of industrialization and structural transformation as solutions to the problem of extreme poverty. My current research includes both historical work on the rise of the East Asian Tigers and contemporary fieldwork in Kenya.
