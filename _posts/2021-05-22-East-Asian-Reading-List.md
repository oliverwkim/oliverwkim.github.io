title: An East Asian Development Reading List

If you read just one book, it should be Joe Studwell's _How Asia Works_. It's not always right, and few of the ideas are really original, but Studwell finds a way to bring together a lot of old arguments that had been quietly gathering dust and synthesize them into something exciting. (An underrated virtue in academia--probably just as useful as novelty.) I would not be studying this topic without it.

Of course, you should probably read more than one book. 

## Neoclassical Views

Young's article has been enormously influential, not least because it found a champion in one Paul Krugman, who wrote a Foreign Affairs article about it: [_The Myth of Asia's Miracle_](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1994-11-01/myth-asias-miracle) is, like most Krugman articles, a joy to read. It is also, unfortunately, quite wrong.



## Korea

## Taiwan

## China

## Hong Kong and Singapore

Hong Kong and Singapore remain deeply misunderstood in the West, functioning as a kind of Rorscharch test for whatever ideological agenda a foreigner is bringing to the table. (Don't get me started on Milton Friedman's _Free to Choose_.) As such I've found little of value written by economists...

Joe Studwell's _Asian Godfathers_ is a little too down for my tastes.

Lee Kuan Yew's _From Third World to First_, which covers Lee's long premiership, starting with Singapore's unceremonious exit from the Malaysian Federation, is worth reading. The book is blatantly self-serving (Lee was famously thin-skinned, fond of suing his perceived enemies into oblivion), but utterly fascinating in how it covers the nuts-and-bolts of how one sets up a country.  Who does one call to get diplomatic recognition from the UN? How does one organize an army from scratch?

(I've always found it funny that, in the original 1960s _Star Trek_, Spock names "Lee Kuan" as one of history's worst would-be world conquerors, up there with Caesar, Napoleon, and Hitler. While he never quite conquered his way out of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew had a nasty authoritarian streak, and likely influenced China's move towards capitalist economics blended with political repression.)




## On the Docket

I can make no claims to [Pseudoerasman](https://pseudoerasmus.com/) levels of omniscience. Here is a list of books that I've been told to read, but haven't gotten to yet. Hopefully over the summer a few of these will graduate up the page:

* _Embedded Autonomy_, by Peter Evans
* _Locked in Place: State-Building and Late Industrialization in India_, by Vivek Chibber
* _Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China_, by Ezra Vogel
