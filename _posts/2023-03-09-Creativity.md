title: Creativity and Economics

Let me begin, somewhat elliptically, with a parable from the great development economist Albert Hirschman. In the mid-1960s, Hirschman visited a paper mill on the Karnaphuli River in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The mill had been built around lush bamboo forests, which were intended to serve as its raw material—until one day not long after opening, when the bamboo flowered all at once, and, "poetically but quite uneconomically", died.

The planners were sent scrambling for solutions: they created a new organization to collect bamboo from villages across the country, and began experiments on new plant species that could fill the gap. The result was a mill with a more diversified resource base, one perhaps better equipped to survive future shocks. (The mill still exists, though it has recently been accused of polluting the river with toxic chemicals.) Ironically, if the planners had known back in the ‘50s that all the bamboo was about to die, they would never have sited the mill where they did. Only by failing to anticipate the difficulties did they forge ahead—and end up creating a more resilient project.

Hirschman later expanded this nugget of developmental wisdom into a general principle of creativity: 

> Creativity always comes as a surprise to us; therefore we can never count on it and we dare not believe in it until it has happened. In other words, we would not consciously engage upon tasks whose success clearly requires that creativity be forthcoming. Hence, the only way in which we can bring our creative resources fully into play is by misjudging the nature of the task…

> ... since we necessarily underestimate our creativity, it is desirable that we underestimate to a roughly similar extent the difficulties of the tasks we face so as to be tricked by these two offsetting underestimates into undertaking tasks that we can, but otherwise would not dare, tackle. The principle is important enough to deserve a name… I propose the Hiding Hand. 

In plainer English, the Hiding Hand conceals from us both the obstacles and the flashes of invention needed to solve them, beckoning us to try for goals just beyond our reach. Overoptimism

Our naïveté about the challenges ahead is the fuel for ambitious goals. Conversely, the mirror of the Hiding Hand sounds a lot like depression, or at least my experience of it. Losing faith in your capabilities means feeling unequal to the challenges that lurk in the day ahead—much better to stay in bed, pull the covers over your face, and pretend you’re in a tent forever.

_(Note: following advice untested. Ask me in a few years how this went.)_

From this we can draw a principle for research: start by picking a big question. One of the big ones, the kind that got you excited to study economics in the first place. Pick something so large that even if chunks of it fall off as you pull it into harbor, it’s still impressive. 

Start today. Don’t try to exhaustively learn every tool before you begin, or you never will. Instead, be confident in your ability to learn and improvise solutions on the fly, remembering that there’s no stronger motivation to actually learn something than needing to use it. The Hiding Hand forces us to expand our capabilities.

After giving a talk, when I’m in that delirious state mixing exhaustion and relief, I often go back through my slides—the same ones I’ve been laboring on for weeks—and find that the work feels like it was done by a stranger. It’s as if I fell asleep and woke up on deadline day, with the research finished and polished up by someone far more capable than lil mediocre ol’ me. 

And that observation, at least the last part, is literally correct—because the work is not in fact done by me, but by a long sequence of mes, accumulating improvisations and micro-inventions to solve each problem as it is met. By picking something big, you can expand your capabilities.

Two caveats are in order. The first is that ambition is no excuse to become a tyrant, either to yourself or others. Being kind is more important, and more lasting. The second is that failure is very much possible. Impossible tasks will always remain impossible, unyielding to ambition. (See hubris.) But there is a satisfaction of its own to setting ambitious goals, regardless of success—particularly if one remembers that below lies a safety net, that the unemployment rate for Economics PhDs is around 0%. Inexplicably, my mind drifts to the words of Tottenham Hotspur’s Danny Blanchflower: if you set your sights very high, “even failure will have in it an echo of glory”. You, too, could win two league titles in 140 years of storied history. 

I write this as a spur to myself, but also those assumed by the academic tribe, by unspoken rule, to be incapable of feats of creative daring: if you’re a woman, or Black, or neurodivergent, or working class, or yes, another sallow-faced Asian clone, who is assumed by nature to be passionless, unimaginative, replaceable---
Go out there and prove them wrong.
