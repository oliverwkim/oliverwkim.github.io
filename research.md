<!-- [Non-Technical Summary] [Historical Appendix] [Technical Appendix] -->

<em><span class="sans">Abstract:</span></em> We study one of the central reforms in China’s economic miracle, the Household Responsibility System (HRS), which decollectivized agriculture starting in 1978. The HRS is commonly seen as having significantly boosted agricultural productivity—but this conclusion rests on unreliable official data. We use historical satellite imagery to generate new measurements of grain yield, independent of official Chinese statistics. Using a difference-in-discontinuities design, we find no causal evidence that provinces that adopted the HRS sooner experienced faster grain yield growth. These results challenge our conventional understanding of decollectivization, land reform, and the origins of the Chinese miracle.

<span class="sans">The Distribution of Power: Decentralization and Favoritism in Public Infrastructure</span>, with Catherine D. Wolfram, Susanna B. Berkouwer, Felipe Vial, Eric Hsu, and Edward Miguel. Submitted. [<a href="{{ site.url }}/papers/LMCP/LMCP_Political_Economy_Main_Submission_2024_06_04.pdf">Draft (June 2024)</a>] [<a href="{{ site.url }}/papers/LMCP/LMCP_Political_Economy_Main_Submission_2024_06_04.pdf">Online Appendix</a>]

<em><span class="sans">Abstract:</span></em> 		Political favoritism can harm economic growth by distorting public investment. But how can researchers identify political bias without observing government objectives? Using granular infrastructure and electoral data, we leverage an institutional feature of Kenya’s nationwide electrification program: a pre-existing transparent allocation formula. Despite constitutional reforms decentralizing fiscal expenditures, pro-government areas received 46% more electrified villages and 35% more household connections than allocated by the formula. Favoritism was exerted by national offices—not Members of Parliament or local construction managers. The benefits of central coordination, technical capacity, and economies of scale may expose infrastructure to continued political capture despite decentralization.

<span class="sans">Land Reform in Taiwan, 1950-1961: Effects on Agriculture and Structural Change</span>, with Jen Kuan Wang. <em>R&R at the Journal of Development Economics.</em> [<a href="{{ site.url }}/papers/KimWang_Taiwan.pdf">Draft (October 2024)</a>]

<em><span class="sans">Abstract:</span></em> 				We study Taiwan’s landmark 1950s land reform, long seen as central to its growth takeoff .Phase II of reform---which redistributed formerly Japanese public lands---boosted rice yields and increased the share of agricultural labor. By contrast, phase III---which broke up larger estates---did not increase yields and pushed female labor into manufacturing. Phase II likely improved yields by lifting crop choice constraints (though it can only explain one-sixth of observed 1950s rice yield growth), while phase III may have made farms inefficiently small. These results challenge longstanding views around land reform and the East Asian Miracle.

<span class="sans" style="color:red">NEW: </span> <span class="sans">Geopolitics and Export Miracles: Firm-Level Evidence from U.S. War Procurement in Korea</span>, with Philipp Barteska, Nathan Lane, and Seung Joo Lee. [<a href="{{ site.url }}/papers/Korean_Exports_and_War_Procurement.pdf">Draft (November 2025)</a>]

<em><span class="sans">Abstract:</span></em> How did geopolitics shape East Asia’s economic development? We show that U.S. war procurement during the Vietnam War---a fiscal shock which peaked at 2.9 percent of South Korea's GDP, rivaling the Marshall Plan---catalyzed Korea’s export-led industrialization. We construct a new firm-level dataset linking Korean export records with U.S. procurement contracts (1966–1974) to estimate the causal impact of winning a contract on export performance. Winning an initial contract increases a firm’s likelihood of exporting by 46 percentage points and triples its export value. These effects extend beyond sales to the United States: treated firms also expanded into third-country markets. We validate our research design using unique, contemporaneous firm-level export targets, showing that contracts were not anticipated and unrelated to export shocks. The policy had lasting effects. We find that firms treated in the 1960s responded more strongly to South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry drive of the 1970s, indicating that U.S. procurement and domestic industrial policy were complementary. Our findings reveal a neglected channel through which Cold War geopolitics helped shape the East Asian economic miracle.
