<em><span class="sans">Abstract:</span></em> We study one of the central reforms in China’s economic miracle, the Household Responsibility System (HRS), which decollectivized agriculture starting in 1978. The HRS is commonly seen as having significantly boosted agricultural productivity—but this conclusion rests on unreliable official data. We use historical satellite imagery to generate new measurements of grain yield, independent of official Chinese statistics. Using a difference-in-discontinuities design, we find no causal evidence that provinces that adopted the HRS sooner experienced faster grain yield growth. These results challenge our conventional understanding of decollectivization, land reform, and the origins of the Chinese miracle.

<em><span class="sans">Abstract:</span></em> Taiwan’s 1950s land reform, which redistributed land to tenant farmers, has long been thought of as central to its growth miracle, but this claim has never been tested with modern
empirical tools. By assembling a novel dataset from historical archives and exploiting a natural
experiment in the second phase of the reform program, we study land reform’s effect on
Taiwan’s economic development. We have three main findings. First, land reform reduced
tenancy and increased the share of smallholder farmers. Second, land reform significantly
increased the yields of rice, Taiwan’s main staple crop. Finally, agricultural productivity
growth pulled labor from the manufacturing sector, consistent with a standard neoclassical
growth model. Considering the large boon to agricultural productivity, these results strongly
suggest that land reform had a large and positive impact on Taiwan’s economic development.
